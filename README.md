#### Info

In October 2024 I participated in an internal software engineering lunch & learn session at IBM. To help illustrate some of the implications of code security, I briefly walked through three individual CVE's (what happened, why and what was the result).

This was a great opportunity to cooperate across business units and I enjoyed it very much. As part of the cybersecurity awareness month I wated to also make the presentation available for wider consumption. Some minor redactions are applied around CVE-2022-2915 in SonicWall SMA gateway.
